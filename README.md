Good day, this research was made while I was studying in Yandex.

**Purpose**: conduct an analysis of the outflow of clients of Metanprombank

**Stages**: 
1) Predict the probability of churn (at the level of the next month) for each client;
2) Form typical client portraits: identify several of the most striking groups and characterize their main properties;
3) Analyze the main features that most strongly influence the churn;
4) Formulate the main conclusions and develop recommendations for improving the quality of work with clients:
    4.1. Identify target customer groups;
    4.2. Suggest measures to reduce outflow;
    4.3 Identify other features of interaction with clients.

**Stack**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, statsmodels

**Ð¡onclusions**: 
1) A data analysis allowed to detect the main customer segments that were affected by churn were identified.
    - Segment 1: men with an account balance of more than 80,000 (3,551 people, 32.07% churn);
    - Segment 2: active clients with an estimated income (salary) of more than 50,000 (4,537 people, 25.85% churn);
